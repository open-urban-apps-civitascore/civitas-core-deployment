# Local pull-through image caches for the k3d dev cluster.
#
# Each upstream registry gets its own `registry:2` running in proxy mode, with a
# persistent named volume. The containers live OUTSIDE k3d (plain Docker, with
# --restart unless-stopped), so they survive `k3d cluster delete` / recreation —
# which is exactly what the variant test harness does between runs.
#
# The cluster reaches them via `host.k3d.internal` (injected by k3d into every
# node) — see the `registries.config` mirrors block in k3d-civitas-local.yaml.
# Those mirror endpoints list the real upstream as a fallback, so the cluster
# keeps working even when these caches are stopped.
#
#   ./dev-deployment/registry-cache.sh up       # start caches (run once)
#   ./dev-deployment/registry-cache.sh status
#   ./dev-deployment/registry-cache.sh down     # stop+remove containers (keep data)
#   ./dev-deployment/registry-cache.sh prune    # also drop the cached data volumes
#
# First pull of an image is slow (populates the cache); every fresh cluster
# afterwards pulls from the local cache and starts in seconds.
